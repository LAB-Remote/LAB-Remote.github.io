	<h2>Hobbies</h2>
	<h3>I typically like to learn languages during my free time, for I love to experience different cultures and communicate fluently with people of different countries in their local languages. The delight on their faces when they find out that I can speak their language never fails to amaze me and warm my heart.</h3>
	<h3>I also love travelling, as it can bring me to many beautiful scenery and sights. I am also able to meet and make new friends from all over the world.</h3>
