            {"id": "6", "name": "Pythagoras", "info": "<u><b>Pythagoras</b></u>, representing Arithmetic, is sitting in the foreground. The two men who are jostling to look over his shoulder recall figures in Leonardo da Vinci's unfinished Adoration of the Magi in the Uffizi. A closer look at Pythagoras text, we recognize his most important discovery of harmony theory (music) and the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 which added together give the sacred number 10 (X). Epogdoon is a natural number which is 1/8 larger than a given number for example 18 is the Epogdoon of 16."},

Heraclitus is also called the dark melancholic philosopher, maybe this is the reason why he is shown thinking and serious.

Once when Alexander the Great went to meet him, he found him sitting in front of his barrel, facing the sun. As a great admirer of Diogenes, Alexander then asked him if there is anything he could give him. Diogenes thought for a while, and then asked politely if the Great King could simply... step aside, because by standing over him with his horse, he was hiding the sun from his face!"},

To Renaissance humanists, Strabo was considered as a philosopher who insisted to consider the Earth linked with the celestial universe. Translation of his Geography in Latin was commissioned by Pope Nicholas V in the 1450s. Strabo was often linked with Ptolemy, as a pair, by Renaissance humanists."},

An explanation is that Raphael used the motif of the crown found on coins from the dynasty of Macedonian kings of the same name who ruled Egypt from 323 to 30 BC"},
            {"id": "14", "name": "Sodoma", "info": "Giovanni Antonio Bazzi, a.k.a. <u><b>Sodoma</b></u>, a Piedmontese and Florentine painter. He must be regarded as an extraordinary genius, because at times he reached the very highest of his ideals, and then at times completely failed. He must also be regarded as a man against whom many writers have thrown mud, and who now can be safely considered as a far greater man than his contemporaries regarded him, and not so evil in disposition as many were prepared to believe him to be."},
            {"id": "15", "name": "Plotinus", "info": "<u><b>Plotinus</b></u>, the founder of Neo-Platonism. He influenced many modern Philosopher's even sometimes unacknowledged. He is described by Porphyry as otherworldly which maybe is the reason that he is shown isolated."},

He studied at Ephesus and spent 12 years at Sikyon. He worked for Alexander the Great and his father Philip."},
